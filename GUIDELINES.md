## Developing For This Project

Thank you very much for your time and interest in this project!

We greatly appreciate that you are here, interested either developing for this project, reporting a bug or making a suggestion

Please read on how to help.

### Development Workflow

1. If you would like to help with code and/or multimedia assets, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
2. Then you create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) from the **[main](https://github.com/FlightGearRepublic/FG-1000/tree/main)** branch.
3. In **your fork** create a new branch with a **descriptive name** of what you are doing or changing. If you are working on spelling improvements, then a good name for your branch will be "SpellingWork". If you are reducing the code size, then a good name would be "CodeRedux"
4. Test your changes, test your code, your assets or whatever you are changing.
5. [Commit](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits) your work to your newly descriptively namely branch in your fork.
6. Test your work again.
7. Once you are sure it doesn't break anything, then create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the **[dev](https://github.com/FlightGearRepublic/FG-1000/tree/dev)** branch of the project.
8. Your PR will be tested by team and if all works well, it will be merged. There is no guarantee or assurance that your contribution will be merged into either `dev` or `main` branches and changes might be requested before your contribution is accepted if accepted at all.

### Branches

+ `main` is the default branch where we put the code that has been tested and it's known to work well.
+ `dev` is the branch where work happens, where PR's are made to and, where we add new features. Once new features and contributions are well tested in the `dev` branch they are merged into the `main` branch.

## Coding Style

Below are some advice on how we expect your code to look like.

**If you don't like this, it's ok, simply don't code for this project.**

### Indentation

#### Tab vs Spaces

+ We use spaces instead of tabs. This should be transparent to your text editor, we juts ask you to have tabs converted into spaces so the identation looks the same to everyone no matter the editor they are using.

#### Tab size.

+ Use 4 spaces for a "tab", to indent the code.
+ If the nesting is too long, then indents of 2 spaces are accepted, as long as it is kept consistent.
